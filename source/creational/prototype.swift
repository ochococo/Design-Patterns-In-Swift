/*:
🃏 Prototype
------------

The prototype pattern is used to instantiate a new object by copying all of the properties of an existing object, creating an independent clone. 
This practise is particularly useful when the construction of a new object is inefficient.

### Example
*/
struct MoonWorker {

    let name: String
    var health: Int = 100

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }

    func clone() -> MoonWorker {
        return MoonWorker(name: name)
    }
}
/*:
### Usage
*/
let prototype = MoonWorker(name: "Sam Bell")

var bell1 = prototype.clone()
bell1.health = 12

var bell2 = prototype.clone()
bell2.health = 23

var bell3 = prototype.clone()
bell3.health = 0
